Config Connector is a Kubernetes add-on that allows customers to manage GCP resources, such as Cloud Spanner or Cloud Storage, through your cluster's API.

With Config Connector, now you can describe GCP resources declaratively using Kubernetes-style configuration. Config Connector will create any new GCP resources and update any existing ones to the state specified by your configuration, and continuously makes sure GCP is kept in sync. The same resource model is the basis of Istio, Knative, Kubernetes, and the Google Cloud Services Platform.
