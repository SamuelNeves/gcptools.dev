gcpdiag is a command-line diagnostics tool for GCP customers. It finds and helps to fix common issues in Google Cloud Platform projects. It is used to test projects against a wide range of best practices and frequent mistakes, based on the troubleshooting experience of the Google Cloud Support team.

gcpdiag is open-source and contributions are welcome! Note that this is not an officially supported Google product, but a community effort. The Google Cloud Support team maintains this code and we do our best to avoid causing any problems in your projects, but we give no guarantees to that end.
